## Introduction
This is a simple weather app created with Java and uses JavaFX for the user interface. The weather data is retrieved using the OpenWeatherMap api and deserialised, using the gson library, into a Weather object. This information is displayed on the user interface and updates accordingly when the refresh button is clicked, or the combobox setting is changed to another city.
